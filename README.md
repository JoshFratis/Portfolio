### Hello! 
Thank you for taking the time to peruse my portfolio. 
Here you'll find scripts I've written or co-written. 

Each has been selected from its project and isolated in a folder structure which mirrors the larger project's. 
If the project is one which is collaborative, such as Steelpunk, you'll find a note on which parts were written by me and which were not at the top of each script.
My website was made by me in its entirety, so the entirety of the project is included without such notes.
