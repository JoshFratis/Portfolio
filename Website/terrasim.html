                        <p>For the summer of 2023, I held the position of an Application Engineer Intern at TerraSim, a
                            subsidiary of Bohemia Interactive Simulations. I worked specifically on the front end and
                            user experience of Mantle ETM, a terrain management platform and service oriented

                    <p> This 3D Tilemap is lit realistically. The sun's position is determined by the real time of day.
                        Before I developed a fix, I always saw the sun shining on Pittsburgh, but the other side would
                        be dark. This posed a problem for customers simulating locations overseas. </p>

                    <p> I iterated across multiple solutions. Manipulating the simulated time of day to reposition the
                        sun behind the camera resulted in a stuttering background and unlit poles. Aligning a
                        directional light with the camera's position was an improvement, but did not light areas viewed
                        at an angle. </p>
                    <p> I settled on a solution which calculates a vector to light the global position at the center of
                        the camera view. </p>

                    <p class="title">Data Overlays</p>
                    <p> I added "Overlays" to the Mantle ETM UI, semi-transparent imagery layers based on GeoServer
                        WebMapService data, allowing users to view their terrain with whichever data is most relevant to
                        them at any given time. Overlays are easily toggleable via this dropdown checkbox menu. </p>
                    <p> Overlays were a long-time UI goal at TerraSim and significantly contributed to the Mantle ETM
                        product. See more Overlays I developed below. </p>

                    <p> "Borders and Labels" is an Overlay which includes country borders and labels for
                        countries, capitals, and cities. Presenting this raw data as intuitively and clearly readable to
                        a user at all scales was a challenging process that required me to learn Style Layer
                        Descriptor XML. </p>
                    <p> I developed the WMS to Overlay pipeline in such a way that anyone can easily configure new
                        Overlays without delving into the details. I thuroughly documented
                        what simple steps remain before departing. </p>

                    <p>
                        I updated the appearance of the inset labels such that they now mesh seamlessly with the UI and
                        match the styling of the Overlays I developed. I worked extensively with the product owner on
                        multiple iterations. At thier request, I conducted user testing among members of the company to
                        discover the optimal design.
