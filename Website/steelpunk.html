                            Pathfinder</a> is a component which can create a map of a 3D space, then use that map to
                        find optimal unobstructed paths between any two points by performing an implementation of the A*
                        algorithm. </p>
                    <p> This is computationally expensive and required careful optimization. The algorithm utilizes
                        time-efficient data structures such as priority queues, hashmaps, and multidimensional arrays.
                        It also runs as a coroutine which distributes the operations across multiple frames. I'm
                        currently working on utilizing Unity's multithreading Job System to increase performance even
                        further. </p>

                    <p> Healers are small drones which repair all damaged enemies within range. </p>
                    <p> Healers are assigned enemies to repair by a single Healer Manager. Assignments are coordinated
                        such that together, they maximize the collective regeneration of all enemies in the room. </p>
                    <p> This coordination is made challenging by a few key constraints. Healers should heal enemies that
                        enter their range and stop healing those that leave it. Yet an enemy should never be healed by
                        more than one healer at a time. </p>
                    <p> The assignment algorithm and the logic that allows Healers to update their assignment on the fly
                        interface with a shared dictionary of all the room's enemies and their states. This enables a
                        coordination which maintains the illusion of intelligence. </p>

                            Effect Items </a> </div>
                    <p> Placeable AoE items are consumables players can cast down on any surface within range. Once
                        placed, the item creates a bubbly field that applies an effect to players or enemies inside it.
                    </p>
                    <p> The effect and its targets are entirely configurable via scriptable objects, allowing us to
                        reuse effects implemented for single-target consumables and weapon damage payloads. </p>

                    <p> This system allows for the application of modifiers to a player's speed. This is currently
                        utilized by a consumable item which temporarily increases the user's speed, but such a modifier
                        could also be applied by equipment, a weapon, or an AoE. </p>

                <h3>Working on a Team</h3>
                <p> Working within a community of similarly inspired game developers is exciting each and every day.
                    It's fulfilling and empowering not only to be doing the work I feel I'm meant to do, but to share
                    that mission with friends. I can't wait to bring the game into the next stage of development and
                    production. </p>

                <h3>Sharpening my Skills</h3>
                <p> The opportunity to solve problems in the Unity editor each and every day has given me the best
                    practice I could ever have. I'm happy to be learning new practical skills and patterns in a hands-on
                    environment. </p>
                <p> On this project, I've solved problems I'd never be assigned in a classroom. Analyzing and optimizing
                    the runtime complexity of algorithms I've written is far more compelling when a player's frame rate
                    is at stake! </p>
                <p> I've also practiced what may be my most valuable skill- understanding and building atop an existing
                    codebase belonging to another developer. I'm now quite comfortable diving into an unfamiliar
                    codebase and quickly coming up to speed in order to make meaningful contributions. </p>

                <h3>Developing the Game</h3>
                <p> I'm incredibly proud to have developed major features and systems that cleanly integrate with and
                    support the rest of the project. </p>
                <p> I find joy in adding layers of complexity and creativity to the game which improve the player
                    experience. </p>
                <p> I've discovered an excitement in developing tools and systems which enable the team to work at a
                    higher level and bring their visions to life </p>
