            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                The Counsel in The Cave follows May,
                a high-school senior soon to graduate. She's
                torn between the promise of an exciting new life at university
                and her peaceful hometown.
                Where is she to lead her life, once graduation passes?
                <br><br>
                In search of answers, May goes looking for her missing guidance
                counselor. She follows their trail to The Layers,
                a magical labyrinth hidden beneath her high school.
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, May's friend Jason follows in her footsteps,
                fearing for her safety.
                By searching for his friend, Jason begins his own journey.
                <br><br>
                On the winding roads below the surface,
                the two meet all manner of wandering folk.
                They're forced to face what it means to be lost.
                Perhaps they'll learn they never needed their counselor at all...

            <h2>The Design</h2>
            <p>
                The choices in The Counsel in The Cave
                may seem strange at first.
                Even meaningless. After all,
                this story only ever had one ending.
                But by giving up a branching narrative,
                The Counsel in The Cave earns something far more meaningful.
                <br><br>
                When challenge mechanics and fail states
                are removed from dialogue choices,
                players are free to consider what’s left:
                the implications each choice holds for
                the life of the character themselves.
                <br><br>
                By making these choices, a player can
                take ownership of their character and
                realize the stories they tell themselves.
                Players develop complex ideas about who
                their characters are. In deciding how to
                express their vision, players become
                creative actors and storytellers
                within the authored narrative.

            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>
                The Counsel in The Cave was written,
                designed and illustrated by Josh Fratis.
                This project was made as part of the Creative Arts Fellowship
                at the University of Pittsburgh Honors College.
                It was written in Ink.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Counsel in The Cave began as a Twine game–
                an interactive adaptation of a poem I wrote.
                Since then, it’s grown a lot! The story is imagined
                to span three acts, each one written in episodic vignettes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even with its expanded scope, I wanted The Counsel in The Cave
                to remain playable in a web browser. This is made possible first by Ink,
                secondly by my own modifications to Ink’s default web export program,
                writen in HTML and JavaScript.
                This is what makes The Counsel in The Cave’s signature stage play style possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three vignettes, one from each of the story's three acts,
                are were released on July 14th, 2022.
                These were be presented at the University of Pittsburgh
                as part of the University Honors College’s Creative Arts Fellowship
                the following fall semester.
